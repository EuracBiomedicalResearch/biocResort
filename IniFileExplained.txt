The ini file assumes:
1) There are two internal qc samples with ids 1015687538 and 1015687523
2) There are three wells on the plate with QC2 from Biocrates (id 721046)

And that you want to do the following:
1) Do the usual starting sequence of Biocrates up to the final calibration injection. 
2) Inject once from all QC samples on the plate: once for QC1, once from all three wells for QC2 and once for QC3 and once from thw two internal QCs
3) Inject once from both internal QC samples
4) Then between every 20 sample injections you want to inject QC1 and the two internal QC samples
and between every 40 sample injections you also want to inject once of each of the wells for QC2
